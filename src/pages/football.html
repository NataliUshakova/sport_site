            The essence of football is that 2 teams of 11 people each try to score a goal against the opponent's goal by kicking or
            heading the ball. Players (other than the goalkeeper) are not allowed to touch the ball with their hands. The goalkeeper
            may handle the ball with his hands within the penalty area. The match consists of 2 halves of 45 minutes, separated by a
            15-minute break. In a number of tournaments, in the event of a draw, extra time of 30 minutes is played (two halves of
            15 minutes each) and if neither side has won, a penalty shoot-out is played. The size of the football field is 100-110 m
            long and 64-75 m wide.
