Boxing should be done in special soft gloves weighing 10 ounces (284 g), striking the front and side of the head and torso of the opponent. Hitting below the belt is prohibited. Gloves used in professional boxing weigh 8 ounces for the flyweight to welterweight categories inclusive and 10 ounces for the rest of the categories (for women, 8 ounces from the "lightest" to "featherweight" weight and 10 ounces from the "first light" to "heavy"). 10 oz gloves can be used in lighter weight classes. </p> <p> Victory can be achieved both after the duel time has elapsed (3 rounds of 3 minutes and for women - 4 rounds of 2 minutes, in professional - 10 or 12 rounds of 3 minutes) - on points, or ahead of schedule - due to a clear advantage, disqualification for violation of the rules, inability or refusal of one of the athletes to continue the fight or knockout. An early victory is awarded by the referee in the ring, on points - by a majority of 5 judges outside the ring. Since 1992, at the Olympic Games, electronic refereeing equipment has been used to calculate the results of the duel. </p> <span>Interesting fact:</span> <p> Oliver Kirk (USA) is the only boxer who managed to win two Olympic champion gold medals in the same competition - III Olympic Games 1904 in the featherweight and lightweight categories. The rules of those years allowed a boxer to perform simultaneously in two adjacent weight categories, provided that his weight did not exceed the lightest of them. Now this rule is gone, and O. Kirk's achievement will remain the only and inimitable. Three times Olympic champions were: Hungarian Laszlo Papp and Cubans Teofilo Stevenson and Felix Savon.</p> </main> <a href="/sport_site/summerSport.html" class="back-btn">back</a> <script src="/sport_site/modal.fa7c8a05.js"></script> <script src="/sport_site/src.5c9de4ee.js"></script> </body></html>
