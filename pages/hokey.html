They play on an ice rink measuring 61 x 30 m with rounded sides 1.22 m high. The team consists of 23 players for men and 20 for women. There are six players on the ice during the game (two defenders, three forwards - left, center and right and goalkeeper). The player who violated the rules is removed from the site for a certain time. Player substitutions are not limited. The game takes 60 minutes of pure time - three periods of 20 minutes with 15-minute breaks. The current rules of hockey were invented in 1879 by students at McGill University in Montreal, who organized the first hockey competitions. </p> <p> In 1890, Ontario hosted a four-team championship. Soon indoor skating rinks with natural ice appeared. To prevent it from melting, narrow gaps were cut in the walls and roofs to allow cold air to enter. The first artificial ice rink was built in Montreal in 1899. </p> <p> The game of hockey became so popular that in 1893, the Governor General of Canada, Lord Frederick Arthur Stanley, bought a cup for 10 guineas to present to the country's champion. This is how the legendary trophy, the Stanley Cup, was born. At first, amateurs fought for it, and since 1910 - professionals. Since 1927, the Stanley Cup has been contested by teams in the National Hockey League. </p> <p> In 1900, a net appeared on the gate. According to legend, Canadian Francis Nilson adapted a fishing net to the gate. Thanks to this novelty, disputes about whether a goal was scored or not stopped. The referee's metal whistle, which stuck to his lips from the cold, was replaced with a bell, and soon with a plastic whistle. At the same time, the puck throw-in was introduced (earlier, the referee used his hands to move the sticks of the opponents to the puck lying on the ice and, having blown a whistle, moved to the side so as not to get hit with the stick). </p> <span>Interesting fact:</span> <p> According to research conducted by the Detroit Free Press, 68% of professional hockey players have lost at least one tooth on the ice.</p> </main> <a href="/sport_site/winterSport.html" class="back-btn">back</a> <script src="/sport_site/modal.a38f7aac.js"></script> <script src="/sport_site/src.bda831f8.js"></script> </body></html>
