The draw in curling looks like this: a player, shod in one sliding shoe, and the second non-slip, from the starting block and disperses a stone across the ice. </p> <p> He can have two goals - knock out someone else's stone or stop his own as close as possible to the center of the scoring zone. Other players are needed to use special brushes to rub the ice in front of the stone, correcting its movement. At the end of each end, points are counted - the team that sets the stone closest to the center becomes the winner. For each own stone that is closer to the center than the opponent's stones, the winners receive one additional point. </p> <p> In 1924, demonstration curling competitions were held at the Winter Olympics in Chamonix. In the same status, curling was shown at the Winter Games of 1932 (Lake Placid), 1988 (Calgary), 1992 (Alberville). The first men's world championship was held only in 1959, and women began to compete 20 years later. Curling was included in the program of the Winter Olympic Games in 1998, at the Games in Nagano. </p> <span>Interesting fact:</span> <p> Before being introduced as an Olympic sport in 1998, some commercials advertised curling as "chess on ice". </p> </main> <a href="/sport_site/winterSport.html" class="back-btn">back</a> <script src="/sport_site/modal.a38f7aac.js"></script> <script src="/sport_site/src.fa87cc9c.js"></script> </body></html>
