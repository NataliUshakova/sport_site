The goal of the game is direct the ball over the net to land it on the opponent's court and prevent the same attempt by the opponent. Team has three hits to return the ball (in addition to the touch on the block). Playground dimensions - 9 m x 18 m, height nets 2.43 m for men and 2.24 m for women. </p> <p> The ball is put into play by a serve: the serving player kicks the ball to the opponent. The rally continues until the ball lands on the playing court, his out-of-bounds or a team error in recovering the ball. </p> <p> In volleyball, the team that wins a rally scores a point (Play-Point System). When the host team wins rally, she scores a point and the right to serve, and her players advance one position clockwise. </p> <p> The game (with the exception of the decisive 5th game) is won by the team that first scores 25 points with an advantage at least two points. In the event of a tie score of 24-24, the game continues until an advantage of 2 points is reached (26-24; 27-25; ...). The winner of the match is the team that wins three games. With an equal score of 2-2, the decisive game (5th) is played up to 15 points and a minimum advantage of 2 points. </p> <p> Each team has up to 12 players, with 6 players on the court at the same time. A team can make up to 6 substitutions players in each game. The number of players may include specialized defenders - libero, up to 2 per command. The libero uniform is distinguished by color from the uniform of other players. Only one libero may be on the court during draw time. The libero replaces a regular player on the court and acts only as a back row player and is prohibited from block and attack the ball above the top of the net. The number of Libero substitutions is not limited. </p> <span>Interesting fact:</span> <p> Volleyball is the only game whose essence is to keep the ball from falling onto the court. The speed of the ball after hitting a volleyball player can be more than 130 km / h, and the hit itself is often made from a height that is noticeably higher than the height of a basketball hoop.</p> </main> <a href="/sport_site/winterSport.html" class="back-btn">back</a> <script src="/sport_site/modal.fa7c8a05.js"></script> <script src="/sport_site/src.5c9de4ee.js"></script> </body></html>
