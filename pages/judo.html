Athletes perform in kimono (loose jacket with a belt and pants) on special mats - tatami. To achieve victory, the attacking wrestler must either throw the opponent on the tatami on the back, or hold for 30 seconds, or hold or choke. </p> <p> Ratings are given according to the following system: a clear victory - "ippon" (10: 0) and "waza-ari" (1: 0). </p> <p> In each weight category at the Olympics, a country can be represented by one wrestler. In 1964, judo competitions were held in three weight categories, in 1972 and 1976 - in five, since 1980 - in seven. From the moment when women's judo debuted at the 1992 Games, fourteen sets of awards have been played - seven each for athletes and athletes. </p> <p> The program of the 2020 Olympics will include another event - a team tournament among mixed teams: three men and three women each. </p> <span>Interesting fact:</span> <p> The first judo school in Russia was opened by Vasily Oshchepkov in 1914, upon his return from the Japanese Kodokan Judo Institute. In the archives of the Kodokan, a record of Oshchepkov's arrival there on October 29, 1911 has been preserved to this day.</p> </main> <a href="/sport_site/summerSport.html" class="back-btn">back</a> <script src="/sport_site/modal.a38f7aac.js"></script> <script src="/sport_site/src.fa87cc9c.js"></script> </body></html>
