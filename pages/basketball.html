Two teams play, usually twelve people, each of which has five players on the court at the same time. The ball can only be held with the hands. Running with the ball without hitting it on the floor, deliberately kicking it, blocking it with any part of the leg, or punching it is not allowed. Most hits in the "basket" is worth two points. Successful throws from behind a semicircle - 6.25 meters (in the NBA-7 m 24 cm) are valued at 3 points, 1 point is awarded for a throw from the penalty line. The match consists of four periods of ten minutes (in the NBA - 12 minutes). The duration of the break between the second and third quarters of the game is fifteen minutes. After a long break, the teams must exchange baskets. </p> <p> The winner in basketball is the team with the most points at the end of playing time. In case of a tie at the end of the regular time of the match, overtime is assigned (5 minutes of extra time), if the score is equal at the end of it, a second, third overtime is assigned until the winner is revealed. </p> <span>Interesting fact:</span> <p> Approximately 30% of NBA players have tattoos on their bodies (on average in America, 4% of residents have tattoos).</p> </main> <a href="/sport_site/summerSport.html" class="back-btn">back</a> <script src="/sport_site/modal.a38f7aac.js"></script> <script src="/sport_site/src.fa87cc9c.js"></script> </body></html>
