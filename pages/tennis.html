The net is stretched over square and round posts with a side and diameter of no more than 15 cm. The goal of the game is to send the ball to the opponent’s half with a racket hit so that he cannot beat it back or beat it off in violation of the rules. 2 players (or 2 teams of 2) are on opposite sides of the net. One of them is the server and puts the ball into play, serves. The second player is the receiver. The task of the players is to direct the ball with the blows of the racket to the side of the opponent, while hitting the ball into the boundaries of the court. The player must have time to hit the ball before it touches the court more than once. The player who makes the mistake loses the rally and his opponent scores a point. Players need to collect points to win games. By gaining games, one of the players wins the set. To win a match, you need to win 2 out of 3 or 3 out of 5 sets. As soon as one of the players reaches the required number of won sets, the match ends. </p> <p> For the game, a hollow rubber ball is used, covered with felt, painted in a bright color, with a closed line of a characteristic shape applied. To strike the ball, the player uses a racket, which consists of a handle and a rounded rim with stretched strings. </p> <span>Interesting fact:</span> <p> Known since the days of the old French game, scoring is based on dividing the day into 24 hours (up to 24 games were played). In turn, hours were divided into four quarters; each successful ball was equal to one quarter of an hour - 15 minutes corresponded to 15 points. Thus, one game lasted up to 60 points, and the count was as follows: 15, 30, 45, 60. Over time, the number of games was reduced to 6 in one set, and every third successful ball is now counted as 10 points, i.e. 40 is declared instead of 45.</p> </main> <a href="/sport_site/summerSport.html" class="back-btn">back</a> <script src="/sport_site/modal.a38f7aac.js"></script> <script src="/sport_site/src.fa87cc9c.js"></script> </body></html>
