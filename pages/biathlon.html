From the time of the first official launch until 1978, the caliber of biathlon rifles was no different from military weapons. </p><p> С 1978 года по наше время официальные соревнования проводятся с использованием малокалиберного оружия, огонь из которого по мишеням (всего – пять) ведется с расстояния 50 м. При этом диаметр мишеней при стрельбе лежа составляет 45 мм, а при стрельбе стоя – 115 мм. </p> <p> The following disciplines are included in the program of the Olympic Games: </p> <p> Individual race. 20 km for men and 15 km for women with four firing lines with a separate start of the participants. The first and third shootings are made from a prone position, the second and fourth - standing. For each miss, one penalty minute is added to the time spent by the athlete to complete the distance. </p> <p> Sprint. The start is the same as in the individual race, separate. The distance is 10 km for men and 7.5 km for women. Shooting at two firing lines (on the first shooting from a prone position, on the second - standing). For each miss, the athlete must run a penalty loop of 150 m. </p> <p> Pursuit. Athletes go to the distance of this race at intervals depending on their delay from the time of the winner of the sprint, which is held the day before. The length of the distance for men is 12.5 km, for women - 10 km, four firing lines (the first and second - shooting from a prone position, the third and fourth - standing). Penalty for each miss is overcoming the penalty loop. </p> <p> Mass start. The 30 strongest (according to the current rating) athletes simultaneously go to a distance of 15 km for men and 12.5 km for women. Shooting at four firing lines (the first and second - shooting from a prone position, the third and fourth - standing). Athletes take their places on the firing lines in accordance with the order of arrival at the shooting range (during the first shooting - in accordance with the starting number). For each miss - a penalty loop of 150 m. </p> <p> Relay race. The competition of national teams consisting of four people, the length of the distance at each stage for men is 7.5 km, for women - 6 km. Shooting is carried out at two firing lines from a prone and standing position. Unlike personal races, a biathlete at each stage, having used five "regular" cartridges and without closing all the targets, uses three additional ones, which he loads manually. If after the use of spare cartridges there are still uncovered targets, the athlete overcomes penalty loops, the number of which corresponds to the number of uncovered targets. Mixed relay. Competition of national teams consisting of two biathletes and two biathletes. It is held according to the rules of classical relay races (the length of the stage for men is 7.5 km, for women - 6 km). At the same time, the first two stages are run by women, and the third and fourth by men. </p> <span>Interesting fact:</span> <p> The earliest experience of biathlon racing is considered to be the competition of the Norwegian Ski Rangers Club in the 60s of the XIX century, which combined cross-country skiing with shooting. Militarized ski marches are also known, which were held in parts of the Red Army (in the early versions, the rifle was with a bayonet, and behind it, in addition to it, there was a duffel bag weighing about 8 kg) from the end of the 20s. Competitions of military patrols were included in the program of the 1st Winter Olympic Games in Chamonix (athletes were awarded Olympic medals), and then two more pre-war White Olympics - in the "out-of-competition program".</p> </main> <a href="/sport_site/winterSport.html" class="back-btn">back</a> <script src="/sport_site/modal.a38f7aac.js"></script> <script src="/sport_site/src.c469ba6b.js"></script> </body></html>
