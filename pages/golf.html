Presumably, the game existed already in the 14th century, and in the 15th century several laws were passed in Scotland prohibiting the game of "gof". In the 17th century, balls were played with clubs already in the Netherlands. The game in its modern form took shape in the 19th century in Scotland. </p> <p> In each game, the player must play a certain number of holes (usually 18) in a certain order. The hole in this case is called both the hole in the ground itself and the entire playing area. There may be various obstacles on the playground - water barriers, sand bunkers, bushes, trees, tall grass. </p> <p> The rules are based on the principle of honesty. As stated on the cover of the official edition of the rules: "Play the ball as it lies, play on the court that is, and in any case do the right thing." In addition to the official rules, golfers should follow the rules and customs adopted in golf, the so-called golf etiquette. Rules of etiquette deal with issues such as safety, fairness, pace of play, and the player's obligation to maintain the golf course. And although there are no penalty points for breaking etiquette, players try to abide by it in order to maintain interest in the game and the opportunity for newcomers to gain experience. </p> <span>Interesting fact:</span> <p> Ball coasters appeared less than a hundred years ago. Before that, golfers sculpted small piles of sand with their own hands.</p> </main> <a href="/sport_site/summerSport.html" class="back-btn">back</a> <script src="/sport_site/modal.a38f7aac.js"></script> <script src="/sport_site/src.c660c3cd.js"></script> </body></html>
