Road cycling is a type of cycling race that takes place on highways and well-paved roads at high speeds over long distances. No more than 200 athletes can participate in each race. There are five main types of road cycling: group race, individual race, criterium, stage race and team race. </p> <p> The Olympic distances of road cycling are not regulated in any way: the distance is different at each Olympic Games. For example, for men in 1896, the group road race distance was 87 km, in 1912 - 320 km, and at the last Games in Beijing - 245 km. For women in 1984, the distance was 79.2 km, and in 2008 - 126 km. </p> <p> Track races are held on an artificial track in a circle. The length of Olympic tracks, the construction of which began after 1972, must be at least 333.33 m. There are several types of races on the track: time trial (or git) - here you don’t have to overtake anyone, but just drive the fastest 1000 m for men and 500 m for women; sprint - three laps on the track, the time in the sprint does not matter - the first racer to reach the finish line wins; individual pursuit, in which you need to catch up with the enemy or show the best time (men compete at a distance of 4 km, women - 3 km); team pursuit - almost the same as the individual, but only for men, at a distance of 4 km and in teams of 4 people; The Olympic sprint is a men's race in which two teams of three people participate. Cross-country mountain biking is a cross-country race consisting of a certain number of laps. Bicycle Motocross (BMX) - BMX competitions are held on small bikes with great maneuverability and high acceleration capability. There are 3 types of BMX - racing, flatland or "dancing on a bike" and freestyle. </p> <span>Interesting fact:</span> <p> In one of the most spectacular disciplines of cycling - sprinting on the track - there is a curious tactic - "surprise" (derived from the French word surplace - "on the spot"). The meaning of the surprise is that the rider riding in front, trying to let the opponent go ahead, stops and balances on the bike standing still. The second athlete usually joins him, and they stand side by side, waiting for the first one to make a mistake, break loose and take an unfavorable first position. In the semi-finals at the 1964 Olympics, two riders stood motionless for 22 minutes.</p> </main> <a href="/sport_site/summerSport.html" class="back-btn">back</a> <script src="/sport_site/modal.fa7c8a05.js"></script> <script src="/sport_site/src.5c9de4ee.js"></script> </body></html>
